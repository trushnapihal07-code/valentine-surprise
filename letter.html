  <h2>💌My Love<br>
 My Dearest Ram Ji</h2>


  <p>
  When I look at you, I don’t just see the man I love…
  I see someone I deeply care for, someone I protect in my prayers,
  someone I feel proud of every single day.
  </p>

  <p>
  Life isn’t always easy. We’ve both seen days filled with smiles
  and days heavy with silence. We’ve had moments where everything
  felt perfect… and moments where things felt uncertain.
  But through every up and every down, one thing in my heart
  has never changed — my love for you.
  </p>

  <p>
  I know you don’t always say what you’re feeling.
  Sometimes you carry your worries quietly.
  In those moments, I wish you could see yourself the way I see you —
  strong, capable, kind, and full of so much potential.
  </p>

  <p>
  I am so proud of you.
  Proud of your efforts.
  Proud of your growth.
  Proud of the way you keep going even when things get hard.
  </p>

  <p>
  Even on the days when you doubt yourself,
  please remember there is someone here
  who believes in you completely.
  </p>

  <p>
  My love is not just about the happy days.
  It’s about standing beside you when you’re tired,
  holding your hand when you feel lost,
  and reminding you of your strength when you forget it.
  </p>

  <p>
  No matter what happens — success or failure,
  smiles or tears — I will stay by your side.
  Not because everything is perfect,
  but because you are worth choosing, again and again.
  </p>

  <p>
  I want to be your peace when the world feels loud.
  Your comfort when your heart feels heavy.
  Your safe place when you need to rest.
  </p>

  <p>
  You don’t have to be strong all the time.
  You don’t have to have everything figured out.
  With me, you can just be you.
  </p>

  <p>
  If forever exists,
  I want it with you.
  </p>

  <div class="signature">
    Forever yours,<br>
    Till my last breath ❤️
